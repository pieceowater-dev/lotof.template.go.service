# lotof.template.go.service

## Description
üöÄ This project is a microservice built with Go, leveraging GORM for database interactions and integrating with RabbitMQ for message brokering. It serves as a central point for managing requests and routing them to the appropriate services.

üîå With a modular architecture, this microservice enables seamless communication across different services, facilitating efficient and scalable application development.

üîí The use of GORM simplifies database operations, while RabbitMQ ensures reliable and asynchronous communication, allowing the microservice to effectively handle high volumes of requests.

üèóÔ∏è Whether you're developing a monolithic application or a distributed system, this microservice provides a robust foundation for your project.
